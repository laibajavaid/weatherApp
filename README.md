# Weather App 

## Purpose

A weather app where the user can enter a city after which it uses an external API to provide information on the city's weather.  This employs React hooks and conditions combined with the Modern Javascript Fetch AP. This was my first project using React JS.

## Built With
HTML

CSS

React JS

## APIs 

* Weather data is retrieved from http://openweathermap.org/

## Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```bash
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
